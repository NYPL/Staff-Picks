## Requirements
`clientId` and `clientSecret` environment variables are **required** and available on AWS via Parameter Store

## Installation
Install all npm dependencies listed under `package.json`
```sh
$ npm install
```

## Running the Application
### Development Mode
We use Webpack to fire off a hot-reloading development server. This allows for continuous code changes without the need to refresh your browser.

```sh
$ clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run dev-api-start
```

> Navigate to http://localhost:3001/books-music-dvds/recommendations/best-books/ya or http://localhost:3001/books-music-dvds/recommendations/best-books/childrens

### Production Mode
To run locally in production mode using the `development` API, run:

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run dev-api-start
```

To use the `production` API, run:
```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run prod-api-start
```


## GIT Workflow
We follow a [feature-branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) workflow. If you need to introduce/update the application code, you `SHOULD`:

* Create a new branch off the `development` branch
* Send a pull request pointing to the `development` branch upon completion
* Once the pull request is approved, it should be merged into the `development` branch
* Travis CI is setup to automatically build and deploy the `development` branch on our Elastic Beanstalk Development server
* If there are several pull requests in process, a release should be scheduled by merging all completed pull requests into the `development` branch
* When a release is scheduled to be deployed, the `development` branch `SHOULD` be merged into the `qa` branch
* Travis CI will build and deploy the `qa` branch into our Elastic Beanstalk QA server
* Upon a successful verification of the application on our staging (QA) environment, the `qa` branch `SHOULD` be merged into the `master` branch
* Travis CI will build and deploy the `master` branch into our Elastic Beanstalk Production server
* All releases merged into `master` `MUST` be tagged and pushed to Github with their corresponding `version`

## Testing
### Unit Tests
Unit tests are currently written in the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework. [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is used as the assertion library and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is used as the React testing utility.

The tests can be found in the `./test` folder.

To run all the tests once, run
```sh
$ npm run test
```

To run the tests continuously for active development, run
```sh
$ npm run test-dev
```

To run a specific test file, run
```sh
$ npm run test-file test/unit/TabElement.test.js
```

### Code Coverage
[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) is used for checking code coverage.

To run the code coverage tool and view a quick report, run

    $ npm run coverage

To run the code coverage tool and view a better report, run

    $ npm run coverage-report

This last command will create a folder called `coverage` in the root directory. You can open up `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser to see more details about what lines of codes have not been tested.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Configuration
All of the AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files exist in the `.ebextensions` directory. AWS will run all config files in numerical order based on the prefix `{NUM}_{FILENAME}.config` naming convention.

You must have AWS CLI installed on your machine with the proper AWS Profiles.

> Note: Please use the instance profile of `_cloudwatchable-beanstalk_`. It is configured with all of the permissions necessary for a traditional or Docker-flavored Beanstalk machine that enables logging to CloudWatch.

### AWS Application Settings
By using the `aws-cli`, developers can deploy the application to the AWS application environments listed below:

| AWS Profile | Application Name | Environment |
|---|---|---|
| `nypl-digital-dev` | `nypl-staff-picks-app` | **QA**: `staff-picks-qa` <br><br> **Production**: `staff-picks-production` |
| `nypl-sandbox` | `nypl-staff-picks-app` | **Development**: `staff-picks-dev`

> Note: All QA and Development servers should be configured with only 1 instance. Production servers are typically setup with auto-scaling supporting 2 or more instances.

### Initialization

To initialize the application on AWS via the `aws-cli` run:

```bash
 eb init -i --profile ${your AWS profile}
```
### Creation of Environment

Initially we want to create the app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk by using this command:
```bash
eb create ${environment name} \
  --instance_type ${size of instance} (Ex: t2.small) \
  --instance_profile cloudwatchable-beanstalk \
  --scale ${amount of instances} (Ex: 1) \
  --cname ${cname prefix} (Ex: XXX.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com) \
  --vpc.id ${ask for custom vpc_id} \
  --vpc.ec2subnets ${privateSubnetId1,privateSubnetId2} \
  --vpc.elbsubnets ${publicSubnetId1,publicSubnetId2} \
  --vpc.elbpublic (exposes the IP to the public) \
  --keyname ${ssh keyname} (allows the given ssh keyname to have ssh access) \
  --profile ${your AWS profile}
```
> Note: This step is only required upon creation and should executed once.

### Deployment
#### AWS Deployment with Continuous Integration & Delivery
Travis CI is configured to run our build and deployment process on AWS.

Our Travis CI/CD pipeline will execute the following steps for each deployment trigger:
* Run unit test coverage
* Run the npm task to build the distribution assets
* Execute the `deploy` hook only for `development`, `qa` and `master` branches to adhere to our AWS Elastic Beanstalk `development`, `qa` and `production` servers
* Developers _do not_ need to manually deploy the application unless an error occurred via Travis

#### Manual/Custom Deployment
Once the application has been created via `eb create ...` all subsequent updates and deployments should use the following command:

```bash
eb deploy ${environment name} --profile ${your AWS profile}
```

### KMS Environment Variables
Staff Picks and the API where the data is fetched from are currently deployed on NYPl's AWS instance. In order to fetch data, we are using the `@nypl/nypl-data-api-client` to make requests to the API with an authentication token. You can find the [full documentation here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nypl/nypl-data-api-client), but to be brief, we need a client id, a client secret, and a token url to authenticate.

We currently have a process in NYPL Digital to get said pair of authentication strings. To be more secure in our AWS environment, we are encrypting those variables with AWS KMS. To encrypt the strings, make sure you have the `aws-cli` tool available on your computer and then run:

```
  $ aws kms encrypt --key-id [your-aws-key-id] --plaintext [string-to-encrypt] --output text --query CiphertextBlob --profile [name-of-your-aws-profile]
```

Running this command will output an base64 encrypted string which will be used as the `KMS_ENV` environment variable in AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app will read the variable, and use the `aws-sdk` library to decrypt it. Once we decrypt it, we can use those values with the `@nypl/nypl-data-api-client` to connect to the API.

As stated above, you will need the client id and secret when running the app locally, but they do not need to be encrypted. The encrypted values will be use in the AWS instances as environment variables and the app will pick those up and use them since the `KMS_ENV` variable will be set to `encrypted` in the Beanstalk instances.

If you would like to use the encrypted variables, you can start the app using:

```
  $ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[encryptedClientId] clientSecret=[encryptedClientSecret] npm run prod-api-start
```
